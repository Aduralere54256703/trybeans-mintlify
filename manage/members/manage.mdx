## Add a member

The easiest way to automatically add customers to your rewards program is to
[integrate Beans](/integrations) with your eCommerce platform, POS, or CMS.
This ensures that customers are automatically enrolled
through any platform you are currently using to manage your orders.

However, there are instances where you may want to manually add a customer to the rewards program.
 This can be handy on specific occasions.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Members** page.
2. From the top right, click on **Add member**.
3. Enter the **first name**, **last name** and **email** of the members that you want to add to the rewards program.
4. Click on `Add member` button to confirm.

Members added to the rewards program will receive the welcome email if you have set it up.

## Deactivate a member

Deactivating a member is a reversible way to prevent a customer from benefiting from the rewards program.
It effectively blacklists the member, stopping them from receiving emails, earning points, spending points,
referring friends, and accessing their earned rewards. No data will be deleted, and you can reactivate
the account later if needed. Even when a member is deactivated, their transaction history remains accessible.
When a customer chooses to opt out of the rewards program or reports rewards program notifications as spam,
their account is automatically deactivated.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Members** page.
2. Find the member that you want to deactivate and open their profile.
3. From the Edit dropdown menu on the top right, click on **Deactivate account**
4. Confirm the deactivation.

## Reactivate a member

All members are active by default. You would only need to reactivate a member,
if their account was previously deactivate.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Members** page.
2. Search the member that you want to reactivate using their email address and open their profile.
3. From  the top right, click on **Reactivate account**

## Delete a member

Deleting a member is a radical solution that effectively erases all the customer data in
the system including their transaction history. This action is irreversible. It is recommended
to use the member deactivation option instead.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Members** page.
2. Find the member that you want to deactivate and open their profile.
3. From the Edit dropdown menu on the top right, click on **Delete memberÂ¬**
4. Confirm the deletion.

## List, filter, and search members

To view all the members of your rewards program, navigate to the Members page from the Beans admin dashboard.

**Filter Members:** Use the filter option on the top right to filter the 
list of members by activation status and points value.

**Search Members:** Use the search bar at the top to find a specific customer by name, email address, or phone number.

## Perform bulk actions

## Import members

Beans offers a simple way to import data in bulk using a comma-separated values (CSV) formatted file.
This is handy if you are migrating from a third-party solution to Beans or
if you want to bulk adjust a large number of customers' balances.

For small updates to a few customers' points balances, manual adjustments are recommended.

Using a spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets,
ensure your CSV file includes the following headers in the first row:

- **email (required):** The email address of the user to import .
- **first_name (optional):** The first name or given name of the user to import.
- **last_name (optional):** The last name or family name of the user to import.
- **points (required):** The amount of points that the user should have after the import.
If the user already exists has less points, but has less points, they will be credited the
difference so that the amount of points after the import matches this amount provided in the CSV.
If the user has less points, they will be no change to their balance after the import.

Here is a [sample CSV file](/assets/images/admin/members/beans-import-members.csv) that you can download for reference.

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Members** page.
2. Click on **Actions > Import Members** in the top right corner.
3. Follow the steps and upload the CSV file
4. Ensure that the fields from your CSV file are correctly mapped to the corresponding Beans fields.
5. Once all fields are mapped correctly, click on the "Start Import" button to begin the import process.

Depending on the amount of data, the import process may take a few hours to complete.
You will receive a confirmation email once the import is finished.
The confirmation email will include a list of any errors encountered during the import.
After the import process is complete, review the imported members in the "Members"
section to ensure all data has been accurately imported.
