The History section in the Beans app provides merchants with a comprehensive record of every transaction
that occurs in their Beans account for every customer. This feature allows for detailed tracking and
management of customer interactions with the rewards program.
It offers a full history of all transactions, including points earned, redeemed, and
expired. Merchants can filter transactions by type, allowing for a better review of specific transaction
types. This helps in analyzing customer behavior and the effectiveness of different reward strategies.
It can be used to get insight into customer activity and reward program performance.

To access the history of transactions, follow these steps:

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **History** page.
2. Use the filter options to narrow down the transactions by type.
3. Review the transaction details and gain insights into customer behavior.

### Managing transactions

It is important to note that recorded transactions cannot be edited or erased unless the customer's account
is deleted. This ensures the integrity of the transaction history and provides an accurate record of all
customer interactions.

### Member-specific transactions

To view a list of specific transactions for a member, go directly to their profile through the **Members**
section. This allows for a focused review of an individual customer's transaction history, making it easier
to manage and address any issues.
