The Beans analytics page provides valuable insights into the performance of your rewards program. It
offers detailed metrics on various aspects of customer engagement and program effectiveness, helping you
make informed decisions to optimize your strategy.

To access the Analytics page, follow these steps:

1. From the Beans admin dashboard, navigate to the **Analytics** page.
2. Review the metrics displayed.
3. Use the filter options to adjust the time period and gain specific insights into your program's
   performance.

## Metrics

In addition to insights on the usage of the rules, the analytics page helps track key metrics such as:

- **New members enrolled**: This metric shows the number of new customers who
  have enrolled in your rewards program over a specified
  period. It helps you understand the growth and reach of your program, allowing you to assess the
  effectiveness of your marketing and engagement efforts.

- **Number of daily redemptions**: Track how frequently customers are redeeming
  their points on a daily basis. This metric provides insights
  into customer engagement and the attractiveness of your redemption options. High redemption rates can
  indicate strong customer interest and satisfaction with the rewards offered.

- **Loyalty revenue**: Loyalty revenue includes orders where customers have used points for redemptions.
  This metric helps you quantify the financial contribution of your rewards program to overall sales.
  Analyzing loyalty revenue can assist in evaluating the return on investment (ROI) of your loyalty initiatives.
