<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 300 and 1000 points per review.</Tip>

The referral rule helps you incentivize customers who recommend
your business to their families and friends by rewarding them.
Customers get rewarded when they refer a friend to your store that completes a purchase.
Referrals are considered successful only when the referred customer is a new customer placing their first order.

## How it works

Each customer who joins your referral program gets access to a unique referral link.
The referral link helps track new customers that are being referred to your store.
From the referral page, the customer can email the referral link to their friends or share it directly on social media.
The customer can copy the link and share it with their friends through any other channel.

After registering for an account on the shop, the referred customer
will get their [referral invite reward](/manage/rules/invitation) if it was set.

A referral is deemed successful when the referred customer makes a purchase using the invite link or code.
When the referral is successful, the referrer gets their reward.
The referrer will only get rewarded for the first order placed by their friend.

## Settings

- **Minimum purchase**: This setting allows you to set a minimum amount for the referral order.
  The referral gets rewarded only if the referral order exceeds the minimum purchase limit.
