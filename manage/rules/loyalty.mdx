<Info>
  The loyalty rule is one of the cornerstone rules of the rewards program and is active by default for all rewards
  programs.
</Info>

<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 5 and 20 points per dollar spent in the store.</Tip>

The loyalty rule determines how customers are rewarded for their purchases in your shop.
By offering points for each dollar spent, you incentivize customers to return and make additional purchases,
thereby increasing customer retention and satisfaction.
This rule allows you to specify the number of points customers will
earn for every dollar (or equivalent currency unit) spent in your store.

## How it works

Points are calculated based on the final value of the order after applying discounts
but before adding shipping fees and taxes.
This method ensures that the rewards are fair and reflect the actual spend on products.

- Discounts applied at checkout decrease the amount of points customers earn for a purchase.
- Shipping costs do not affect how many points customers earn for a purchase.
- Taxes applied at checkout do not affect how many points customers earn for a purchase.
- Taxes included in the product price increase the amount of points customers earn for a purchase.

For example, consider the following order details:

- Rule value: 5 points/$
- Subtotal (Cart value): $100
- Discount (Coupon code): $20
- Shipping Fees: $30
- Taxes: $40
- Total: $150

In this scenario, points are awarded based on the subtotal after the discount.
The customer will earn points on the $80 spent on products, excluding shipping fees and taxes.

```math
Points earned = Rule value * (Subtotal − Discount) = 5 points/$ * ($100−$20) = 400 points
```

### Order status

**Payment status**: Customers are awarded points only when the order has been paid.
Orders pending payment do not receive points.

**Order cancellations**: When an order is cancelled, the points awarded for that order are also cancelled.

**Partial refunds**: When an order is partially refunded, the customer loyalty points associated with that order
are removed in proportion to the amount refunded. This maintains the accuracy of the rewards program.
