<Info>
  The register rule is one of the cornerstone rules of the rewards program and is active by default for all rewards
  programs.
</Info>

<Tip>The recommended value for this rule is between 100 and 500 points.</Tip>

The register rule allows you to reward customers when they sign up to your rewards program.
This rule is essential for encouraging new customers to join your rewards program and immediately see its value.
With a starting points balance, new members are more likely to make their first purchase to utilize their rewards.

## How it works

A customer visits your online store and decides to register for the rewards program.
As soon as they complete the registration process, they are awarded 200 points (assuming this is the set value).
This immediate reward makes them feel valued and encourages them
to explore the store and make a purchase to use their points.
