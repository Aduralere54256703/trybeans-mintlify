<Tip>The recommended period for this rule is 365 days.</Tip>

The expiration rule is designed to encourage customers to use their points within a certain timeframe.
This rule helps maintain the effectiveness of your rewards program by
ensuring that points are actively used rather than hoarded.
The expiration rule specifies that points earned by customers will expire after a set number of days.

## How it works

Points will expire after the specified period, calculated from the date they were earned.
It is important to note that when customers redeem their points, the oldest points are used first.

#### Example 1

- On January 15th, 2024, a customer earns 1,000 points.
- By January 14th, 2025, the customer has not used the points earned.
- On January 15th, 2025, the 1,000 points earned on January 15th, 2024, will expire.
  The customer will have 0 points.

#### Example 2

- On January 15th, 2024, a customer earns 1,000 points.
- On March 20th, 2024, the customer spends 400 points, leaving a balance of 600 points.
- By January 14th, 2025, the customer has not used the remaining points.
- On January 15th, 2025, the remaining 600 points earned on January 15th, 2024, will expire.
  The customer will have 0 points.

#### Example 3

- On January 15th, 2024, a customer earns 1,000 points.
- On March 20th, 2024, the customer spends 400 points, leaving a balance of 600 points.
- On September 5th, 2024, the customer earns an additional 800 points, resulting in a total balance of 1,400 points.
- By January 14th, 2025, the customer has not used the remaining points.
- On January 15th, 2025, the remaining 600 points earned on January 15th, 2024, will expire.
  The customer will have 800 points remaining.

#### Example 4

- On November 18th, 2024, the customer spends 500 points, leaving a balance of 900 points.
- By January 14th, 2025, the customer has not used the remaining points.
- On January 15th, 2025, no points will expire as the oldest points are from September 5th, 2024.
  The customer will still have 900 points.
