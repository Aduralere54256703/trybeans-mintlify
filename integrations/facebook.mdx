## Rules

### Points for Facebook page like

This feature allows you to reward customers with loyalty points when they like your Facebook page.
It's an effective method to boost your Facebook page's visibility and engage customers with your brand on social media.

**How it works:** Once you enable this feature, customers can earn points by liking your Facebook page.
This applies to both new and existing followers, ensuring that all your customers have the opportunity to be rewarded.

**Important details:** Customers are rewarded with points only once for liking the page. The system ensures that points
are not awarded multiple times to the same customer, even if they unlike and re-like the page.
If a customer decides to unlike your page, the points previously awarded for liking the page will not be taken back.

## Status

This interface provides control over the status and data synchronization between Beans and Facebook,
offering options to disconnect the integration, or reset the connection as needed.

To access the status page:

1. Navigate to the Facebook integration home page
2. Click on **Status** in the integration navigation menu.
