## Metrics

A metric indicates a specific type of event that occurred within the Beans app
and was subsequently synced to your Klaviyo account.
The following events are synced to your Klaviyo account.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Beans member created">
    This event is triggered when a customer joins the loyalty program.
    Use this metric to set up a welcome email to customers who join the rewards program.

    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans points credited">
    This event is triggered when a customer earns points.
    Use this metric to send customers an email notification when they earn points.
    Customers appreciate instant gratification. Sending notifications promptly upon point accrual
    reinforces their positive behavior and encourages repeat purchases.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans tier downgraded">

  effectively and provide a clear explanation of why the tier downgrade occurred.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "13580"
    Beans Member Points Value: "135.8"

    This event activates when a customer initiates a referral by sending an invitation.

    they have been invited to shop at your store, courtesy of the referrer.
    This notification serves as a warm introduction to your store and encourages
    the invitee to take their first step towards a rewarding shopping experience.

    ```yaml
    Beans Reward Value: "500 points"
    Beans Referrer Name: "Yan"
    Beans Referral Link: "https://example.com?_br=BOT22!email"
    $value: "0"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans friend rewarded">
    This event is triggered when a referred friend successfully earns their reward.
    It is pivotal for notifying the new customer about their available reward.
    It's a gesture that celebrates their acceptance of the referral invitation and
    encourages their engagement with your offerings.

    ```yaml
    Beans Reward Target: "friend"
    Beans Reward Value: "500 points"
    Beans Reward Code: "REFERX15"
    $value: "0"
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Beans referrer rewarded">
    This event triggers when the original referrer receives their reward,
    following the successful first purchase by the person they referred.
    It's an opportunity to use this event for sending a notification to the referrer,
    acknowledging their successful referral and the reward they've earned as a result.
    This notification reinforces the value of sharing referrals and
    rewards their effort in expanding your community of customers.

    ```yaml
    Beans Reward Target: "friend"
    Beans Reward Value: "500 points"
    Beans Reward Code: "REFERX15"
    $value: "0"
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Balance reminder

<Warning>
  The process for sending balance reminders through Klaviyo involves a manual step due to a specific limitation within
  Klaviyo's system, which currently does not support the automation of periodic events. Consequently, merchants are
  required to create these reminder campaigns manually each time they wish to notify customers about their unused
  points.
</Warning>

Periodic balance reminder emails are a crucial component of engaging customers
with their accumulated loyalty points. These reminders serve as a polite prompt
to customers, highlighting that they have unused points available for redemption
towards rewards. It’s an effective strategy to encourage repeat purchases and
deepen customer engagement with your loyalty program.

When integrating Beans with Klaviyo, balance reminder emails are facilitated through
the creation of a dedicated campaign in Klaviyo. Beans ensures seamless synchronization
of all necessary data, including points balances, to Klaviyo. Below is an extensive overview
of the rewards program attributes that are synchronized to Klaviyo, enabling a smooth and efficient reminder process.

    ```yaml
    Beans Member ID: "acc_08cvj8r0f4mbw1"
    Beans Member Points: "13580"
    Beans Member Points Value: "135.8"
    Beans Member Birthday: "2000-10-05"
    Beans Tier: "Gold"
    Beans Tier Next: "Diamond"
    Beans Tier Next Milestone: "20000"
    Beans Tier Expiring Days: "220"
    Beans Tier Progress: "15600"
    Beans Referral Code: "YAN22"
    Beans Referral Code: "https://example.com?_br=YAN22!email"
    Beans Referral Count: "4"
    ```

## Event logs

The events log section gives you insights into the synchronization process between Beans and Klaviyo,
allowing you to quickly debug synchronization issues. It is an overview of the most recent

<Warning>
  You can only inspect events log associated to a single metric at a time. Use the filter option to select the metric
  that you want to inspect.
</Warning>

To access the events log page:

1. Navigate to Klaviyo integration home page

offering options to disconnect the integration, or reset the connection as needed.
