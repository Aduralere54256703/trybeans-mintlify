[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) is a widely-used platform that connects people and brands through visual content.
The [integration between Beans and Instagram](https://www.trybeans.com/integrations/trellis:instagram)
enables merchants to significantly boost their brand engagement by offering a
compelling incentive such as rewarding customers for following the brand's account on Instagram.
This innovative collaboration helps merchants capitalize on visual interactions
to build customer loyalty and elevate their online presence.

## Setup

1. From the Beans admin, go to **Integrations**.
2. Locate **Instagram** in the list of available integrations.
3. Click on the **Connect** button and proceed as directed.
4. Grant Beans permission to access your Instagram account.

## Rules

### Points for Instagram Follow

This feature allows you to reward customers with loyalty points
when they follow your Instagram page, enhancing engagement and growing your social media presence.

**How it works:** Once you enable this feature, customers can earn points by following your brand on Instagram.
This applies to both new and existing followers, ensuring all your customers have the opportunity to be rewarded.

**Important details:** Customers are rewarded with points only once for following the page.
The system ensures that points are not awarded multiple times to the same customer,
even if they unfollow and refollow the page. If a customer decides to unfollow your brand,
the points previously awarded for following will not be revoked.
